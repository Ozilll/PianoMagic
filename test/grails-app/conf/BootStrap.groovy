Python was conceived in the late 1980s[16] and its implementation was started in December 1989[17] by Guido van
Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL)[18] capable of exception
handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[1] Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his
continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python
community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features including a full garbage collector and
support for Unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more
transparent and community-backed process.[19]
Python 3.0 (also called Python 3000 or py3k), a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on 3 December
2008[20] after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have been backported to the backwards-compatible
Python 2.6 and 2.7.[21]
Python has been awarded a TIOBE Programming Language of the Year award twice (in 2007 and 2010), which is given to the
language with the greatest growth in popularity over the course of a year, as measured by the TIOBE index.[22]'''

1. Add "less" to INSTALLED_APPS setting.
2. Make sure that you have lessc executable installed. See LESS official site for details.
3. Optionally, you can specify the full path to lessc executable with LESS_EXECUTABLE setting. By default it's set to lessc.
4. In case you use Django’s staticfiles contrib app you have to add django-less’s file finder to the STATICFILES_FINDERS setting, for example :

    STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
        # other finders..
        'less.finders.LessFinder',
    )

##Example usage
###Inline

    {% load less %}

###External file

    {% load less %}

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ STATIC_URL}}{% less "path/to/styles.less" %}" />

renders to

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/media/LESS_CACHE/path/to/styles-91ce1f66f583.css" />

The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that
a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up
with tags or formatting instructions. *While Markdown’s* syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

The best way to get a feel for Markdown’s formatting syntax is simply to look at a Markdown-formatted document. For

You can also deploy or undeploy artifacts, such as JDBC drivers, and add or remove resources. There is also the
ability to execute CLI commands.

###Goals overview:

* jboss-as:add-resource adds a resource.
* jboss-as:deploy deploys the application to.
* jboss-as:deploy-artifact deploys an arbitrary artifact to the server.
* jboss-as:redeploy redeploys the application.
* jboss-as:undeploy undeploys the application.
* jboss-as:run runs the application server and deploys your application.
* jboss-as:execute-commands executes commands on the running server.

###Usage
General instructions on how to use the JBoss AS7 Deployment Plugin can be found on the usage page. Some more
specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
additional examples, tips or errata to the JBoss Application Server wiki page.

In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the FAQ and feel free to
contact the user mailing list. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could already contain the answer
to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching the mail archive.'''

keystrokes entered will not be displayed on the screen immediately.''',

released in 1961, had a mechanical key lockout feature designed to smooth out typists' irregular keystrokes that,
to many users, felt like typeahead.

Achieving true typeahead requires maintaining a so-called "typeahead buffer"—a FIFO queue, for instance—whose role
it is to store a limited amount of keyboard input until it is called for. Installing such a buffer can be done at
both the hardware and the software levels; most modern operating systems, such as Unix, implement this using software,
calling kernel interrupts.

In some network operations, one might attempt to dispatch information over a network, regardless whether the receiving
program manages to keep up, using the recipient's typeahead functions. However, as this is far too reliant on the
specifications of the computer with which one is communicating, it is not often used.'''

Facilities to arrange one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between classes are provided. In addition to managing
associations between objects, Hibernate can also manage reflexive associations where an object has a one-to-many
relationship with other instances of its own type.

Hibernate supports the mapping of custom value types. This makes the following scenarios possible:

* Overriding the default SQL type that Hibernate chooses when mapping a column to a property.
* Mapping Java Enum to columns as if they were regular properties.
* Mapping a single property to multiple columns.
